# enigma_v2

## Rubric Self-Assessment

__Functionality - 2__
"One of the following are not successfully implemented: Eniga#encrypt, Enigma#decrypt, command line interfaces"
- My decrypt interface does not work.

__OOP - 3__
"Project is broken into logical components that are appropriately encapsulated. No classes are unreasonably small or large, or contain knowledge/information/behavior that they shouldnâ€™t know about. Student can articulate the single responsibilities of the various components"
- Part of starting over and refactoring into smaller components has everything to do with OOP.
- Although in this version I only have one file (enigma.rb) I think it's overall functionality and effectiveness speaks to my ability to problem solve and slim down from not knowing to knowing.

__Ruby Conventions and Mechanics - 3__
"Code is mostly properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention. Some enumerables/data structures chosen are the most efficient tool for a given job, and students can speak as to why those enumerables/data structures were chosen. At least one hash is implemented in a way that makes logical sense."

__Test Driven Development 3__
"Every method is tested at both the unit and integration level, and completely verify expected behavior (i.e., if a single method does 3 things, all 3 things are explicitly tested). Obvious edge cases are addressed. git history demonstrates students are writing tests before implementation code. Test coverage metrics show coverage at 99% or greater."
- This is better shown on my initial enigma project, and while it is weak here, it's mostly because this was my way of refactoring.  Everything I wrote was tested, each line meticulously.  And even if the 100% coverage of Simplecov doesn't prove that, my prior version definitely depicts it.  I go line by line on the test, in pry, on my code.

__Version Control 4__
"At least 30 commits. Most pull requests include related and logical chunks of functionality, and are named and documented to clearly communicate the purpose of the pull request. No more than 3 commits include multiple pieces of functionality."

- Again, the fatigue and need to reach functionality doesn't showcase well for my project I am submitting, however, this is a case where my prior project can showcase why I'm deserving of a 4.

Enigma v2 = ~20 commits & 3 branches
Enigma = 105 commits & 11 branches

## What I wrote before I realized there was a self-assessment required: 
I came back and started over with this project.  I'm proud on how I was able to slim my methods down and learned some pretty awesome features.

I would've liked to have stronger commit messages and branching in this round, but speed and adaptation were of main importance.  That is why I would like to offer the information for my first attempt at Enigma

[First Attempt at Enigma](https://github.com/Arique1104/enigma)
- 105 + commits
- 11 branches

I found that in reconfiguring into this new Enigma, the commits were fewer and so were the number of branches. I think that is because I was more focused this second round, clearer about where I had been and where I needed to go.  However, the result is an appearance of not having enough commits or useful branches.


The initial design was:

```ruby
Enigma
^
Decryption
^
Encryption
^
Offset
^
The Keys
```

As I went coding and got closer to Enigma, I realized that I had too many pieces of functionality scattered illogically throughout my classes.

Secondary Design
```ruby
Enigma
^
Decryption.txt
^
Encryption.txt > Encryption Module
^
Offset
^
Offset Calculations
^
Today Date
^
Key Feature
^
The Keys
```
This was even more of a hot mess but I got some serious learning done.

In this final iteration of my project, the design was simpler:

```ruby
Decrypt.rb
^
Encrypt.rb
^
Enigma < Date Module
```
With the Enigma#Encrypt taking me the longest to learn and refactor.

> FROM 76 LINES TO 16.

That is one of my proudest wins in this project.


CODE LEARNINGS

`.rotate!` will permanently rotate an array which perfectly resolved the problem I was having about each key rotated by `a-d_key`'s different offset numbers.

`% 10000` will give you the last four digits of a long digit number

`@key[0..1]` did you know you could use array-like syntax to get a range within a string?  That was news to me, but when I found it I kept it!

`rand(99999)` is the code I ended up keeping for generating my random key. This isn't one of my favorites, but it is elegant and simple.  It scares me because 1 could also be randomly picked within this key and the right adjustment w/ "0" took too much out of my hands, and made me feel uncomfortable.  But it works, I have to trust it'll work.

`.split(//)` became an all-time favorite for me in this project!


## Future Iterations
`key - failure`
- I really struggled to find documentation to help me figure out this bug:
```ruby
3) Failure:
EnigmaTest#test_it_has_attributes [test/enigma_test.rb:22]:
--- expected
+++ actual
@@ -1 +1,3 @@
-5
+# encoding: US-ASCII
+#    valid: true
+"89553"
```
- Aside from the error of NOT figuring out mocks and stubs, the "encoding:US-ASCII..." is a bug I could not figure out how to get rid of.


`mocks and stubs`
- I am not where I want to be in my understanding and execution of mocks and stubs.  I have some tests that will consistently fail because of working random code and changing date.  Mocks and stubs would've fixed this, but I couldn't get it to work properly.  I am not comprehending the object versus result versus mock versus stub dynamic.

`modules`
- I would've liked to implement at least one proper module in this project.  When I first tried, I used it as a last ditch effort in my enigma v1.  That did not end well.  In theory, I should be able to use the full body of the encrypt and decrypt methods because they use the exact same information.  Polymorphism and I have some serious trust issues.  
- If I had more time, I would've liked to play with a "Cryptable" module (do you like that? it's the only letters that decrypt and encrypt have in common with the module naming convention.)  However, I shy'd away from that because I didn't have a clear analysis of state vs. behavior.
- The only real difference is that my keys are made negative to decrypt and positive to encrypt.  But testing and designing that didn't come on time for me this round.

`DRY`
I do not have dry code.  I recognize that.  

## File I/O
I never thought I would get to this part.  It is not perfect but it is almost functioning.  The encryption works perfectly.  But decryption has some bugs I couldn't figure out.

### Encrypt
SAMPLE CODE GIVEN FROM TURING SCHOOL
`$ ruby ./lib/encrypt.rb message.txt encrypted.txt`

- Works when I put this in the terminal:
 `ruby encrypt.rb message.txt encrypted.txt`

#### RESULT
`{:encryption=>"vescb cfelk!\n", :date=>"060820", :key=>"12345"}`



### Decrypt
SAMPLE CODE GIVEN FROM TURING SCHOOL
`$ ruby ./lib/decrypt.rb encrypted.txt decrypted.txt 82648 240818`

- Works when I put this in the terminal:
`decrypt.rb encrypted.txt decrypted.txt`

- However, I need to copy the encrypted message exactly because it prints with `\n` and `\` all over the place!  And it doesn't respond to .chomp or .gsub nor does it decipher it.

#### WHEN I DON'T COPY PASTE THE ENCRYPTED MESSAGE:
`{:encryption=>
  "{:ywprryfihw=>\"drswkmcznyk!\\ \",i:dubr=>\"060820\",m:dnk=>\"12345\"}",
 :date=>"060820",
 :key=>"12345"}`

#### WHEN I COPY PASTE THE ENCRYPTED MESSAGE:
`{:encryption=>"hello world!", :date=>"060820", :key=>"12345"}`
